Below is a figure of Total applications recieved by year from `r min(files$crystal$YEAR)` to `r max(files$crystal$YEAR)`. 

```{r, results = 'asis', error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
files$crystal %>% 
  select(DEGR, MAJOR, `Year Term`, ID, YEAR) %>%
  distinct %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>% 
  summarise(`Total Applications` = length(ID)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = YEAR, y = `Total Applications`, group = 1)) +
  theme_bw()
```
